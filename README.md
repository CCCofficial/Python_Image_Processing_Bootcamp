# SCIP_PythonImageProcessing
Self-paced instructional programs to teach Python-based image processing. Written for Google’s Colaboratory (“Colab”) platform. Each module is a self-contained Jupyter notebook with text and images explaining the purpose of the module, links to papers and videos covering the topic, and a sequence of code segments and their output, to teach programming concepts and methods. Please note, when you download the code you might have to change the pointers to the image and video files. The test and training images are zip compressed for the files are too large to save in github uncompressed (25Mb limit), so you will need to download and unzip them. The video of plankton swimming useful for tracking, detection and classification has been split into two parts (planktonWhite_1920_1080_part1 and _part2) using FFMPEG.
